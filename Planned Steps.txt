🔹 1. UX / UI Enhancements

Auto-scroll to latest message
So when a new message is added, the chat view scrolls to the bottom automatically.

Replace “Send” with an icon (e.g., > or SendHorizontal from lucide-react) for a cleaner modern look.

Message bubble styling
Differentiate bot vs. user messages with background colors and alignment (left = bot, right = user).

Loading indicator
When the bot is “typing,” show a spinner or animated dots in the chat window.

🔹 2. Functional Improvements

Keyboard shortcuts
Pressing Enter sends, Shift+Enter creates a newline.

Message persistence
Save messages in localStorage so if the user refreshes, history isn’t lost.

Scrollable history
If messages are long, ensure smooth scroll + auto-stick to the bottom until the user manually scrolls up.

🔹 3. Integration / Next Level

Backend API
Connect your chat to your Node.js/Cloud Run backend instead of a dummy “Thanks, noted!”.

AI Integration
Plug into Vertex AI Gemini / LLM pipeline so responses are smart.

Streaming responses
Messages appear word-by-word instead of all at once (like ChatGPT).
